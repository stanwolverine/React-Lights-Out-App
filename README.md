# Lights Out Game Project

Your goal in this game is to try to turn off all the lights.

**Beware**: Clicking on a "turned on light" will cause other "turned on lights" to turn off and "turned off lights" to "turn on" in 4 directions.

### How i build this?!

> Some of the game logic was provided to me by instructor, I had to **work on the REACT stuff** and to solve the missing pieces of puzzle.
